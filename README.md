# Pimcore 2025.4 + Studio UI (Docker, ready-to-use)

This repository provides a **fully working Pimcore 2025.4 local development environment** with the **new Pimcore Studio (Backend + UI)** already configured.

The goal of this project is simple:

> **Clone → Docker up → Run a few commands → Start working with Pimcore Studio**

This repo exists because, as of Pimcore **2025.4**, installing the new Studio stack requires combining multiple pieces of documentation with no clear step-by-step path:
- Platform Version
- Generic Execution Engine
- Generic Data Index
- OpenSearch
- Mercure
- Studio Backend
- Studio UI
- New parameters on config.yaml
- Messenger + Supervisor configuration

All that work is already done here.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Missing topic parameter" on /hub
This is correct! It means Mercure is working. The endpoint expects SSE connections with a topic parameter.

### Permission errors on var/
```bash
docker compose exec php chmod -R 777 var/
```

### OpenSearch not connecting
Wait a few seconds after `docker compose up -d`. OpenSearch takes time to initialize.
